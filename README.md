# Assignment_3_JS
 This assignment is not just help me to gain practical on javascript but it also taught me many knowledge from making a login system to how to utilize built-in method in js such as appendchild, createElement, classList add or remove a class. Especially foreach method which i used to check over the indexes of the options array.
 This assignment required some basic math solution to handlle tasks, especially when dealing with the progress bar and function to show the next question. 
 I think this is a fun and very useful experience for me, to hand on practice with javascript on how to apply function and its method to create a fully functioned website.
